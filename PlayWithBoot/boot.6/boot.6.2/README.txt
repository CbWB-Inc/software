boot.6.2

  さて、この一連のソースは「OSを書く：初歩から一歩ずつ（https://postd.cc/writing-an-os-baby-steps/）」
  に乗っかって作ってきたものです。
  取り上げた題材も練習問題で上がっているものです。
  作者に敬意を払って私なりの答えを書いておこうと思います。
  コメントをそれなりに入れたので、どの問題に対応しているかはわかると思います。
  楽しかったです♪


boot.6.2

  This entire series of source files has been built on top of  
  “Writing an OS: Baby Steps” (https://postd.cc/writing-an-os-baby-steps/).

  Many of the exercises I tackled here were directly inspired by that article.

  As a way of showing respect to the author,  
  I wrote my own answers to the practice tasks — in my own way.

  I added some comments, too,  
  so hopefully it’s clear which code corresponds to which question.

  I had a great time working through it all 😊
