# boot.6.2

## 🗾 概要（Japanese）

この一連のソースたちは、  
「OSを書く：初歩から一歩ずつ（https://postd.cc/writing-an-os-baby-steps/）」  
の記事をベースに構築してきたものです。

掲載されていた練習問題を、ひとつずつ実装しながら試してきました。

最後に、**作者の方への敬意**を込めて、  
それらの問いに対する「わたしなりの答え」を記しておこうと思いました。

コード内にコメントをそこそこ入れてあるので、  
「どの問題を扱っているか」は分かるはずです。

楽しかったです！😊

## 🌐 Overview（English）

This series of boot experiments was built in reference to  
“Writing an OS: Baby Steps” (https://postd.cc/writing-an-os-baby-steps/).

Many of the tasks and code snippets were inspired by the exercises in that article.

As a tribute to the original author,  
I wrote my own take on the practice tasks — in assembly.

There are inline comments to help identify which code answers which question.

It was a joy working through all of this! 😊
